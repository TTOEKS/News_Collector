News Collector Android Studio JAVA

***I wanted make News Collector for peoples who want get more information and read news more comfortable***  
The biggest reason i made is I need these functions

here is functions I made    
### 1. News Collect.
it collect 10 news data each topic using web Crawling,  

Collecting information is down below  
Headline, Context, URL.

### 2. Display News  
it display each news data under the topic using vertical recyclerview


### 3. Favorite Topic  
if user set favorite topic this topic have had high prioirty,  
so these favorite topics always display higher than unfavorite topics.


if user set unfavorite topic at Preference, this topic is no longer display

### 4. Push Alarm  
First user should set admit push alarm at Preference, and user should set time they wanna get push alarm. 
(I recommand time that you can read news comfortable on couch)  
this function might be remind you reading a news
